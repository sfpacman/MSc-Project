\paragraph{}
10X marker-based Classification: 
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Difficult to automate/code- require manual/human input
&& Classification based on human observation/judgment && Cut-off point for selection is arbitrary 
&& Gene-markers are selected sole base on past literature

\end{easylist}
\paragraph{}
Danaher's marker-based:
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Systematic approach
&& All marker genes are tested and selected for their specificity and applicability as marker
&& Specific method for selecting cell identify  
& Only tested on bulk-RNA seq data 
\end{easylist}
\paragraph{}
10X FACS markers:
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Lack of discriminatory power (specificity)
& Not used to id cell cluster but rather used as QC (except CD14+ Monocyte,Dendritic & CD8+ Cytotoxic T - because of the detection of multiple cluster)
\end{easylist}
\paragraph{}
10X population correlation:
\begin{easylist}[itemize]

& Doesn't require prior knowledge of cell type 
&& pro: able to id new cell cluster 
&& Con: no experimental evidences to support  
& Data normalization and selection becomes more critical than the last two methods 
& Still require manual adjustment for disambiguating results from some overlapping population 
\end{easylist}
