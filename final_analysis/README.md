## PBMC68K Analysis 
The following R-scripts are used for
### Danaher's marker 
* **PBMC68K.R** : process rawd ata to produce normalized expression matrix and k-mean clustering results for subsequent analysis   
* **danaher_def.R**: produce a list of genes for each cell type defined by Danaher's study 
* **danaher_alt.R**: assign cell type for each clusters 
## Simulated Sample Analysis
* **sampling.R**: functions used to sample and assemble a sample data from 11 downsampled purified population  
* **Sample_Process.R**: produce a sample gene expression of 2750 cells as well as normalized expression data and k-mean clustering
* **Sample_Analysis.R**: analysis
